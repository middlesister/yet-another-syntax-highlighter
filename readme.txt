== Description ==

This plugin will add syntax highlighting for your code snippets using [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/).
It is based on the [wp-highlight.js](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-highlightjs/) plugin by Igor Kalnitsky, but updated to use the settings API.

I made it for my own use because I liked the color schemes of highlight.js and many other plugins contained features I didn't need. For that reason there are not a lot of features in the plugin, simply select the color scheme you want with an option to add additional css for tweaking. I might add more options or features in the future if need arises.

The bundled highlight.js includes support for:
bash, ruby, diff, javascript, xml, markdown, css, http, java, php, python, sql, ini, perl, json and apache


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Settings>Code Highlighter and select the style you want to use for your syntax highlighting
